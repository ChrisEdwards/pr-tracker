## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## MCP Agent Mail: coordination for multi-agent workflows

What it is
- A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources.
- Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations, with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

Why it's useful
- Prevents agents from stepping on each other with explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs.
- Keeps communication out of your token budget by storing messages in a per-project archive.
- Offers quick reads (`resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`) and macros that bundle common flows.

How to use effectively
1) Same repository
   - Register an identity: call `ensure_project`, then `register_agent` using this repo's absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before you edit: `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)` to signal intent and avoid conflict.
   - Communicate with threads: use `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`; check inbox with `fetch_inbox` and acknowledge with `acknowledge_message`.
   - Read fast: `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20` or `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.
   - Tip: set `AGENT_NAME` in your environment so the pre-commit guard can block commits that conflict with others' active exclusive file reservations.

2) Across different repos in one project (e.g., Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend)
   - Option A (single project bus): register both sides under the same `project_key` (shared key/path). Keep reservation patterns specific (e.g., `frontend/**` vs `backend/**`).
   - Option B (separate projects): each repo has its own `project_key`; use `macro_contact_handshake` or `request_contact`/`respond_contact` to link agents, then message directly. Keep a shared `thread_id` (e.g., ticket key) across repos for clean summaries/audits.

Macros vs granular tools
- Prefer macros when you want speed or are on a smaller model: `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
- Use granular tools when you need control: `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`.

Common pitfalls
- "from_agent not registered": always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first.
- "FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT": adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use a non-exclusive reservation when appropriate.
- Auth errors: if JWT+JWKS is enabled, include a bearer token with a `kid` that matches server JWKS; static bearer is used only when JWT is disabled.


## Integrating with Beads (dependency-aware task planning)

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency-aware issue database and a CLI (`bd`) for selecting "ready work," setting priorities, and tracking status. It complements MCP Agent Mail's messaging, audit trail, and file-reservation signals. Project: [steveyegge/beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)

Recommended conventions
- **Single source of truth**: Use **Beads** for task status/priority/dependencies; use **Agent Mail** for conversation, decisions, and attachments (audit).
- **Shared identifiers**: Use the Beads issue id (e.g., `bd-123`) as the Mail `thread_id` and prefix message subjects with `[bd-123]`.
- **Reservations**: When starting a `bd-###` task, call `file_reservation_paths(...)` for the affected paths; include the issue id in the `reason` and release on completion.

Typical flow (agents)
1) **Pick ready work** (Beads)
   - `bd ready --json` → choose one item (highest priority, no blockers)
2) **Reserve edit surface** (Mail)
   - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="bd-123")`
3) **Announce start** (Mail)
   - `send_message(..., thread_id="bd-123", subject="[bd-123] Start: <short title>", ack_required=true)`
4) **Work and update**
   - Reply in-thread with progress and attach artifacts/images; keep the discussion in one thread per issue id
5) **Complete and release**
   - `bd close bd-123 --reason "Completed"` (Beads is status authority)
   - `release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])`
   - Final Mail reply: `[bd-123] Completed` with summary and links

Mapping cheat-sheet
- **Mail `thread_id`** ↔ `bd-###`
- **Mail subject**: `[bd-###] …`
- **File reservation `reason`**: `bd-###`
- **Commit messages (optional)**: include `bd-###` for traceability

Event mirroring (optional automation)
- On `bd update --status blocked`, send a high-importance Mail message in thread `bd-###` describing the blocker.
- On Mail "ACK overdue" for a critical decision, add a Beads label (e.g., `needs-ack`) or bump priority to surface it in `bd ready`.

Pitfalls to avoid
- Don't create or manage tasks in Mail; treat Beads as the single task queue.
- Always include `bd-###` in message `thread_id` to avoid ID drift across tools.


## Issue Tracking with Beads
We use beads for issue tracking and work planning. If you need more information, execute `bd quickstart`

## Testing Requirements
Write tests for any changes made in this codebase. All code must build successfully, pass linting, and all tests must pass before marking a bead as closed.

## Agent Protocol
- PR links: use gh pr view/diff instead of pasting URLs.
- Add notes to AGENTS only when the user says “make a note”; edit AGENTS.MD (ignore CLAUDE.md symlink).
- Need an upstream file? Redirect to /tmp/, then cherry-pick—never overwrite tracked files.
- Bug fixes: add a regression test when it makes sense.
- Keep files under ~500 LOC—refactor/split and improve quality/tests while you do it.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test; e.g., feat(api): add telemetry, chore!: drop support for iOS 16).
- “Open in code”: run code <path>.
- “Check CI”: use gh run list/view; rerun/fix until green.
- Aim for end-to-end debug/test; if blocked, surface what’s missing.
- Relax grammar to be more concise when you talk to user.

## Docs
- Keep notes brief; update docs whenever behavior or APIs change—no feature ships without matching docs.

## Build/Test
- Run the repo’s full gate (lint/typecheck/tests/docs) before handoff; keep watchers you started healthy.
- If CI is red, drive it with gh run list/view, rerun, fix, and push until green.

## Critical Thinking
- Chase root cause, not band-aids—trace upstream and fix the real break.
- Unsure? Read more code first; if still blocked, ask with a short options summary.
- Flag conflicting instructions and propose the safer path.
- Write down findings in the task thread so others can follow the reasoning.

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)
bv

# CLI commands for agents (use these instead)
bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
bd list --status=open # All open issues
bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
bd create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
bd update <id> --status=in_progress
bd close <id> --reason="Completed"
bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
bd sync               # Commit and push changes
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
bd sync                 # Commit beads changes
git commit -m "..."     # Commit code
bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes
git push                # Push to remote
```

### Best Practices

- Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always `bd sync` before ending session
